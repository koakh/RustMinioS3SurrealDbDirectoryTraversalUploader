Todo:
  ✔ new name for nodes is storage_node @done(24-03-22 21:39)
  ☐ check if content exists by sha256 hash in db and skip it, 
    but update its path etc
  ✔ @critical add extension, and mimeType to importer with mime type, get it from c3 project, lib to get mimeTypes from c3 @done(24-10-25 19:58)
    group by extension / mimeType to know what type of extensions we have
  ✔ replace all `Arakén` words with `Arakém` @done(24-10-25 20:01)
  ☐ add authenticated to StorageNode ?
    pub authenticated: bool,              SQUEMA DEF false published to
    error saving node: Api(
      Query(
          "There was a problem with the database: Found NONE for field `authenticated`, with record `storage_node:root`, but expected a bool",

    createdFiles
    skippedFiles
    suplicatedFiles
    createdDirs
    skippedDirs



  ☐ @low use rust to generate thumbnails in images
  ☐ @low use folder icon, if is a nodeType dir
    thumbnail if dir mimetype is DIR and not unknown.svg
  ☐ @low implement executeShell command in traverse
  ☐ @low and use mimeTypes prop VIDEO and IMAGE to automatically generate thumbnails and push it to 
    default-bucket/assets/thumbnails/samefilename.png extension
  ✔ in the end find all "s3Thumbnail": "default-bucket/images/mime-type/unknown.svg" @done(24-10-28 19:36)
  ☐ falta tif fileType and mimeType

TODO: directories dont have file fileName, fileExtension, s3Url in db
  update storage_node SET fileExtension = none, s3Url = none WHERE nodeType = 'dir' && fileExtension = ".unk";

all rename test with
